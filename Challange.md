##Task Overview
- Create a Community Page (Frontend Only) with the following features:
- Post Creation:
- Allow users to create a new post.
###Comments on Posts:
- Allow users to comment under a post.
###Nested Comments:
- Users can add comments under other comments (nested structure).
###View Existing Data:
- Display a small set of mock posts and comments so the page looks populated.



##Requirements
- Use React with TypeScript.
- Styling can be done in Tailwind CSS.
- Keep the codebase clean with appropriate separation of concerns (e.g., components, hooks, utilities).
- Comments should be displayed in a nested structure with clear distinction between levels (e.g., using indentation or visual hierarchy).
- Focus on quality over quantity of the code. We expect clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.


##Deliverables
- Functional frontend of the community page.
- Code should be submitted with clear README instructions on running the project locally.
- Use of mock data (JSON or array of items) to simulate existing posts and commentsâ€”no backend required.
- Comments in the code where necessary to explain functionality or design choices.



##Evaluation Criteria
- Quality of code (readability, modularity, and maintainability).
- Proper use of TypeScript for type safety.
- User experience (UI/UX design and responsiveness).
- Adherence to best practices in React, Tailwind CSS, and any additional libraries used.
